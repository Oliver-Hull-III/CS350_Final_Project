Mark is initing, cloning git statusing and push pulling for the first time. Now I'm modifying this text file!


ONLY THE VERY VERY FIRST TIME git init used to create the git repository on your machine

git clone <url> to pull all the data from the url's repository

git status to see what is being tracked, what is not tracked, what is a new file...etc

git add <filename> to add the file to the "staging area" ...pretty much means that it's ready to be committed

git commit updates to your local repository 

git push updates to the remote repository


git pull takes the file from the remote repository down to your computer
